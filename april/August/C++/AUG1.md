# C++

C++ is a an Object Oriented Programming language, Which gives a clear structre to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

Can be used to develope appls that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

C++ was developed as an extemsio of C and both languages have almost the same syntax.

we use ''#'' So we can work with inputs

C++ ignores white space, this helpd us make more readable code.

in C++ program we always use ``int main()`` This is a function. Any code inside the curly branckets  will be executed.

every C++ statement endds with a semicolon.

return ends the function. 

A computer Program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by the computer. In a programming language, these programming instructions are called "statements".

IF you forget the semicolon then you weill get an error.

The statements are executed , one by one, in the same order as they are written.

``cout`` is a part of the C++ Standard Library and used for printing out data to the console. it is it is defined in the `<iostream>` header and is part of the standard C++ library's input-output stream classes. 

the ``cout`` object together with the ``<<` operator is used to output values/ print text. Multiple``

multiple ``couts`` will not make for a new line. If you want to insert a new line, You can use the ``\n`` character. I you use two ``\n`` characters after each other you will create a blank line. Another way to insert the new line, is with the ``endl`` manipulator.
