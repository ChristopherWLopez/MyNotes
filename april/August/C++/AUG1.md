# C++

C++ is a an Object Oriented Programming language, Which gives a clear structre to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

Can be used to develope appls that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

C++ was developed as an extemsio of C and both languages have almost the same syntax.

we use ''#'' So we can work with inputs

C++ ignores white space, this helpd us make more readable code.

in C++ program we always use ``int main()`` This is a function. Any code inside the curly branckets  will be executed.

every C++ statement endds with a semicolon.

return ends the function.
