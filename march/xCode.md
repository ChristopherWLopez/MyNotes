What is a type : its a type something is

Int is a number

created variable of type Int (whole number)
``var highScore: Int = 0``

our highScore is a numver is a type ``type`` int

## float

has atleast 6 decimal places
`` var percentComplete : Double = 0.76 ``

## double

``0.7652145865222``
has atleast 15 decimal places. This is not a requirement inorder to use a double it is just something that you can do if you need to be very precise

You dont need to use the decimal places in order to use these Types, it is just their capabilities.

## String

A string is a string of text. This is signified by using the double quotes

``var userThought : String = "I hope I get to eat pizza today``

## Bool

this is true or false

``var truth : Bool = true``

These are the basic types that we can use in swift, however there are instance where we can create our own types.

``var Chris : Person = Person(named:"Chris")``

## Type inference

Swift is able to infer the type of variable we are create. Type inference works most of the time

## Variables and Constants

variables and constants "capture a value"

a constants (``let``)are immutible and are often a "safty feature" it also offers a bit of performance perl since a variable can be changed and that possibiliy needs to taken into consideration.

A ``var`` is something that can be changed there for if you have a variable that is likely to be updated it is wise to use ``var``
